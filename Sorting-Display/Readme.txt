Java project that demonstrates three different sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort. It's a graphical representation of how these sorting algorithms work on an array of integers. Here's a detailed breakdown of the project:

What Does the Project Do?

Visualization of Sorting Algorithms: The code creates a graphical user interface (GUI) using Swing to visualize the sorting process for three different algorithms. The sorting process is shown in three separate panels, one for each algorithm.
Random Array Generation: An array of integers is randomly shuffled, and the same shuffled array is used as the input for all three sorting algorithms.
Color-Coded Visualization: The code uses different colors to represent different aspects of the sorting process. For example, red and blue colors are used to highlight the elements being compared, and green is used to indicate sorted elements.


Important Programming Concepts or Tools:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The code is organized into classes, with inheritance used to create specific sorting panels.
Swing Framework: The project uses Swing to create the GUI components, such as JFrame and JPanel.
Multithreading: Each sorting algorithm runs in its own thread, allowing for simultaneous execution and visualization.
Abstract Classes: The DisplayPanel class is an abstract class that provides common functionality for the specific sorting panels. It implements the Runnable interface, and each subclass must provide an implementation for the run method.
Graphics: The paintComponent method is used to draw the graphical representation of the sorting process.
Expected Inputs and Outputs:
Inputs: The main input to the application is the array of integers, which is randomly shuffled at the beginning. Parameters like the size of the array and the sleep time between steps are hardcoded.
Outputs: The output is a visual representation of the sorting process for the three algorithms. The GUI displays the array as columns, and the user can watch as the algorithms sort the array step by step.

Summary:
This project serves as an educational tool to understand how different sorting algorithms work. By visualizing the sorting process, it provides a clear and intuitive understanding of the mechanics of Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort. It employs key programming concepts like OOP, multithreading, and graphics, making it a valuable learning resource for those studying computer science or software development.
